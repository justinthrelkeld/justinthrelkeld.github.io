Malcolm Gladwell makes an interesting observation here on the limits of general American tolerance: we’ll tolerate just about any difference right up to the point that you stop trying to become more like “us.” This strikes me as not just true about religious tolerance as is the context of this interview, but also in a much more general sense.

Overall, it's a great little discussion of how we view others who hold different beliefs, the inconsistancies we have in those views, and what that means for our society. Very balanced, very thoughtful &emdash; definitely worth a listen.

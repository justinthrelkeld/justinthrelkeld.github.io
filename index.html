  <h1>Look, Another GitHub Blog!</h1>
  <h2>Just what the world needs</h2>
  <p>This page <del>was</del> <ins>wasn't</ins> created with Bootstrap. It was created with <a href="http://assemble.io">Assemble</a> and <a href="http://neat.bourbon.io">Bourbon Neat.</a></p>
  <p>It's the very earliest version of my new blog. I've been using Wordpress for way too long and need to take control of my life. As a developer there is really no excuse for this to have taken so long.</p>
  <p>Soon, there will be much, much more.</p>

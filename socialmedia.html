  <h1>Social Media for Fun and Profit</h1>
  <p>  So you want to learn a little bit about using social media. Great. I&#39;m definitely not what I would consider and expert on it, but I&#39;ve been using various social networks long enough to have picked up some useful tips. Here&#39;s a collection of social media knowledge that I find useful: tools, tips, and explainations that I find myself giving to people over and over again. I&#39;m writing them down in order to share them more effeciently.</p>
<h1 id="overview-of-social-networks">Overview of social networks</h1>
<p>It&#39;s important to understand that social networks are really just communities. With that knowledge, you can gain a good sense of what networks are right for you and how to best make use of each one. Just like real-life communities, social networks have culture that&#39;s a central part of the experience. Often times the sites are specifically designed to encourage a distinct flavor of culture, right down the to terms and conditions.</p>
<h2 id="facebook">Facebook</h2>
<p>The power to share and make the world more open and connected. </p>
<p>People use Facebook to stay connected with friends and family, to discover what’s going on in the world, and to share and express what matters to them. Posts can be text, pictures, or links. Mentions and hashtags are allowed, you can tag people in posts and pictures, and add a location to posts. Facebook also allows creation of groups and events — public and private.</p>
<p>If you want a more public presence, Facebook pages allow you to connect with a much wider audience without sharing personal details. Good for businesses or public figures, pages also allow advertising and promotional features.</p>

<h2 id="instagram">Instagram</h2>
<p>Capture and Share the World&#39;s Moments</p>
<p>Picture sharing website. &quot;Instagrammers&quot; share square pictures via a mobile app available on all major platforms. Pictures can have a caption that contains hashtags and mentions. The official app also allows you to post images to Facebook, Foursquare, Tumblr, and Twitter.</p>

<h2 id="google-">Google+</h2>
<p>An authoritative source of online identity.</p>
<p>Large posts, less itself well to photos and videos. Highly centered around community. Groups, pages, &quot;circles,&quot; and &quot;hangouts.&quot;</p>
<p>Google+ profiles rank very well in Google searches and provide a powerful way to control the information Google provides about you or your business.</p>

<h2 id="foursquare">Foursquare</h2>
<p>Foursquare helps you meet up with friends on-the-go, discover new places, and gives personalized recommendations. Follow friends, share check-ins and tips, and see where their friends are and what other users recommend. A check-in is a post marking your location at a specific place.</p>
<p>Places have general info: address, phone numbers, websites, hours, and menus and Foursquare-specific info like number of people who have been there, how many liked it, and tips.</p>
<p>Businesses on Foursquare can offer specials to new visitors, repeat customers, and the most frequent visitor.</p>

<h2 id="tumblr">Tumblr</h2>
<p>Tumblr lets you effortlessly share anything.</p>
<p>Post text, photos, quotes, links, music, and videos from your browser, phone, desktop, email or wherever you happen to be. You can customize everything, from colors to your theme&#39;s HTML. Tagging, following, favoriting, reblogging (share on your blog, add your own comments), submissions.</p>
<p>The official blogs for Vine, Instagram, Foursquare, Twitter, and (obviously) Tumblr are all powered by Tumblr, so there&#39;s definitely something to it.</p>

<h2 id="so-many-more">so many more</h2>
<p>There are a ton of other networks out there. The important thing is to make sure to understand what the purpose of the network is before you decide to join it.</p>
<h1 id="using-social-media">Using social media</h1>
<h2 id="setting-up">Setting up</h2>
<h3 id="choosing-networks">Choosing Networks</h3>
<p>Register your identity everywhere, but don&#39;t feel compelled to be active on the network unless you have a clear reason for being on the network.</p>
<p>KISS metrics <a href="http://blog.kissmetrics.com/which-social-accounts-matter/?utm_content=bufferb1e54&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer">recommends a mix of networks</a> that balances big sites like Facebook and Twitter with smaller niche sites like reddit or Pinterest. </p>
<p>The important thing is to not spread yourself thin. A few well-tended media accounts are better than a collection of neglected profiles. Make choices based on who you&#39;re trying to reach and what you have to say.</p>
<h3 id="branding">Branding</h3>
<p>Use your name where possible and appropriate. Use a distinct nickname. Keep in mind that the names you pick are an important part of how you&#39;ll promote and manage your profiles.</p>
<p>Choose an image that represents you and fits with the site. For individuals, a headshot is always good. Avatars/caricatures/illustrations/personal logos work, but not everywhere (Facebook).  Businesses should use a logo, absolutely, everywhere. Make sure to crop it square.</p>
<p>Most (every?) site gives you a space to write a short Bio. Lengths will vary from site to site, but they are always important since it&#39;s often the first thing people will see and they&#39;re often shown in search results. Choose a good intro line, something that reflects you and what you&#39;re trying to do.</p>
<h3 id="deciding-what-to-post">Deciding what to post</h3>
<p>Figuring out what you&#39;ll be posting is the most important part of setting up your social media accounts. It&#39;s quite literally (as far a social media is concerned) all you&#39;ll be talking about. What you post is the reason people look at your profile, it&#39;s the value you bring to the network, it&#39;s what you&#39;ll be known for.</p>
<p>Make sure to understand the rules of the community you&#39;re joining. Official terms and conditions are important, unofficial rules and customs are important. Violate either and you&#39;re going to come off as ignorant, get yourself banned from the site, or have a very unsuccessful experience with the network.</p>
<h2 id="security">Security</h2>
<p>Social networks are public. Never post anything that you couldn&#39;t handle having out in the world. While there is some control, privacy on the Internet is a fragile thing and it&#39;s better to not get caught with your pants down.</p>
<p>Make sure you understand the privacy settings for each network. Every one has a different set of options and only you can pick the right ones for you. </p>
<p>Be aware of what you&#39;re sharing and whether it&#39;s appropriate. Know that if you post a picture of yourself enjoying a cup of coffee, there&#39;s a chance the whole world might know where you are. Just be aware, don&#39;t be paranoid about it.</p>
<h3 id="use-strong-passwords-">Use strong passwords.</h3>
<p>Last week a security researcher made a startling announcement: after analyzing several million passwords he found that ninety-one percent of people surveyed used one of the top <a href="https://xato.net/passwords/more-top-worst-passwords/">1,000 passwords</a>.</p>
<h3 id="don-t-reuse-passwords-">Don&#39;t reuse passwords.</h3>
<p>If someone was to crack your password, there&#39;s nothing stopping them from using it on all your other accounts. If it&#39;s the same password, they&#39;re home free.</p>
<h3 id="know-how-to-check-for-suspicious-activity-">Know how to check for suspicious activity.</h3>
<p>Many sites will show you where you&#39;re currently logged in from, when you signed in last, and whether there have been any recent failed login attempts. This is often listed under <code>Account Settings &gt; Security</code> or a similar option.</p>
<p>If you notice logins or attempts that you&#39;re sure weren&#39;t you, change your password just to be safe.</p>
<h3 id="keep-your-authorized-apps-list-weeded-out-">Keep your authorized apps list weeded out.</h3>
<p>Every time you click &quot;sign in with Twitter,&quot; you are giving someone else permission to access your account. That&#39;s not bad (it&#39;s often useful), but it&#39;s important to revoke that permission from apps that you no longer use. If you&#39;ve given permission to another website to post to your Facebook account, and that other website is hacked, the hackers would be able to post to your account.</p>
<p>Most services are trustworthy—and if they&#39;re not, why are you trusting them?—but sometimes they can change ownership or get hacked. Make sure you&#39;re only authorizing apps you regularly use.</p>
<h2 id="citizenship">Citizenship</h2>
<p>Social networks are communities. Make sure you understand the values and purpose of the community and are adding to it&#39;s culture. Do that and you&#39;ll become a valuable (and hopefully loved) member of the community.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t be a vampire, sucking the life out of things. Don&#39;t hijack conversations. Don&#39;t spam people. Don&#39;t be creepy.</p>
<p>With great power comes great responsibility. As you grow into your social media god-hood, keep in mind that information is power. Don&#39;t be creepy, don&#39;t be weird, be nice, be helpful, don&#39;t share things that were obviously not intended for others.</p>
<h1 id="tools">Tools</h1>
<h2 id="1password">1Password</h2>
<p>Generate strong passwords, never forget them, have them available everywhere, easily share them when needed.<br><a href="https://agilebits.com/onepassword">agilebits.com/onepassword</a></p>
<p>Reminds you to change your password.  </p>
<p>Mac and Windows. Plugins for Firefox, Safari, and Chrome, Internet Explorer. iOS app, Android app.</p>
<p>Other password managers are out there. Pick one that works for you and use it.</p>
<h2 id="ifttt-zapier">IFTTT &amp; Zapier</h2>
<p>Automate things to make life easier. IFTTT is more user friendly and 100% free. Zapier offers more integrations, but offers lots of paid upgrades.<br><a href="http://ifttt.com">ifttt.com</a><br><a href="http://zapier.com">zapier.com</a></p>

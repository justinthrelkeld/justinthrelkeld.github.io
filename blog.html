<h1>OnCanvas: a Method for Better Web Sidebars</h1>
<p>On Canvas is a method my coworker and I developed to allow intuitive and semantic slider menus for responsive websites. It is essentially opposite of the (apparently) popular off canvas technique. The idea for OnCanvas is simple: instead of positioning the menu elements outside the browser window and sliding them in via a body class, we absolutely position the menus behind our main element and use a body class to slide that main element over, revealing the menu.</p>
<p>The main benefit we found was that only one element must be acted upon in order to accomplish the sliding action. From an aesthetics standpoint, a slide transition like this looks more “natural” than many Off Canvas implementations I’ve seen. Additionally, our DOM seems to be presented in a cleaner fashion and the manipulations require minimal JavaScript.</p>
<p>Now, I might be late to the party on this, and there might be some yet-undiscovered reason for not using this method, but our research didn’t turn up any sources that used a similar method, and we couldn’t find any browser or performance issues. I am planning to investigate further and compare to existing methods as I continue to refine the technique.</p>
<p>If you like the idea, let me know. I’m working on a kick-ass template for this in HAML and SASS and I’d love to have some feedback.</p>
<p>View it as a <a href="https://gist.github.com/justinthrelkeld/6889080">Gist on Github</a> or play with it on <a href="http://cdpn.io/sgDvi">Codepen</a>.</p>



<h1>A Podcast Shortlist</h1>
<p>I spend a lot of time commuting to my day job. The drive in isn’t so bad, but I can spend upwards of an hour and a half getting home some days. The best use of that time: podcasts. I’ve always loved podcasts because they’re easy to digest and there’s so much variety.</p>
<p>In the last few months, I’ve tested out a lot of podcasts. This is my shortlist (and I highly recommend you try at least one of them):</p>
<h2 id="99-invisible">99% Invisible</h2>
<p>Roman Mars will always have a place in my heart. His philosophy on design and brilliant storytelling make 99% Invisible my number one podcast of all time. Usually ranging from 11 to 30 minutes, each episode tells a story of design that most people would never consider. Best part: regardless of order, each episode is better than the last. (Aside: His voice will enthrall you.)</p>
<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/99-invisible/id394775318">iTunes</a> / <a href="https://soundcloud.com/roman-mars">SoundCloud</a></p>
<h2 id="this-american-life">This American Life</h2>
<p>While a little long for my taste (most podcasts are), This American Life tells two or three stories centering on a single theme. While the themes run the gamut of American culture, the personal stories and tiny details are always revealing and often captivating.</p>
<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/this-american-life/id201671138">iTunes</a></p>
<h2 id="on-the-media">On The Media</h2>
<p>A critique on our national media, each episode covers a current reporting trend or issue. The discussions and interviews on current media topics, ethics, and responsibility are always thought-provoking, at the very least. I find it a little long at times, but it’s a great way to get a view on the current media climate.</p>
<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/on-the-media/id73330715">iTunes</a></p>
<h2 id="freakonomics-radio">Freakonomics Radio</h2>
<p>The economics of everything, in small pieces. I love it because economics are everywhere, and the ideas presented are usually unconventional. Drawing from a wide area of knowledge is important to my work as a designer, so this financial perspective helps round out my field of attention.</p>
<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/freakonomics-radio/id354668519">iTunes</a></p>
<h2 id="design-observer-s-design-matters">Design Observer’s Design Matters</h2>
<p>While not my favorite interviewer, Debbie Millman lands interviews with my favorite designers. I don’t listen to every episode, but the ones with Stefan Sagmiester, Jessica Walsh, Roman Mars, and Erik Spiekermann are informative and interesting. Next episode on my list: Jessica Heische.</p>
<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/design-matters-debbie-millman/id328074695">iTunes</a></p>
<p>If you haven’t gathered, my tastes are pretty narrow and I have a low tolerance for poor quality work. These podcasts are the top of my list for their production value and content. I hope you enjoy them. If there’s a podcast I need to hear, let me know on <a href="http://twitter.com/justinthrelkeld">Twitter</a>.</p>



<h1>Things I was happy to have paid for in 2013</h1>
<p>These are a few things I’ve been using a lot in the last year. I figured I’d share them. Maybe you’re looking for some comfy chinos or a pen that lets a lefty write letters and not smudges. Let me know if there’s something you think I should try in 2014!</p>
<h2 id="harry-s-razors">Harry’s Razors</h2>
<p>The most affordable razor blades I’ve ever enjoyed using. I get a super close shave even after a month of shaving at least once every day.</p>
<h2 id="moleskine-notebooks">Moleskine Notebooks</h2>
<p>These notebooks are a theme in my life. Some call them overpriced, but I find them to be just affordable enough to be practical and just expensive enough to make me feel bad for not using them. The small sizes are perfect for thoughts, notes, and sketches.</p>
<h2 id="shave-oil">Shave Oil</h2>
<p>I’ve only just discovered this fantastic category of shave product, so I don’t have anything to say about specific brands, but the shave oil I’m using has me hooked. Rub a few drops on a wet face. Benefits include closer shave, less razor burn, cool and refreshing, great smell, a bottle lasts forever. I’ll be exploring this stuff a little more (if the bottle I currently have ever runs out).</p>
<h2 id="zebra-f-301-ballpoint-pens">Zebra F-301 Ballpoint Pens</h2>
<p>These are the only pens I’ve yet to use without leaving illegible smears where the letters should have been. Not perfectly smudge-free and a tad bit expensive, but they have good line quality. I can use them to take notes and make sketches. Don’t use the gel version, those are crap.</p>
<h2 id="staedtler-lead-holder">Staedtler Lead Holder</h2>
<p>A fat, hard piece of graphite gripped firmly in talons of steel.  Makes you feel like a pro. Best sketching tool ever.</p>
<h2 id="evernote-premium">Evernote Premium</h2>
<p>I wasn’t sure if this one was going to be worth it, but shared notebooks and premium syncing has changed how I take and organize notes. I can finally stop hoarding all those tiny scraps of paper and napkins. Keeping note-related images out of my camera roll is a boon, too.</p>
<h2 id="bombay-gin">Bombay Gin</h2>
<p>Not much to say here, but this gin is good to sip and affordable to sip every day. It also mixes well (but what gin does’t, really?).</p>
<h2 id="iphone">iPhone</h2>
<p>Apple’s iPhone is the only device I’ve ever found to increase my focus and help me set good habits. There are reasons to dislike it, but my overall feelings are positive. Since getting an iPhone, I take more (and better) notes—offline as well as digital—read more, and spend less time on the computer.</p>
<h2 id="bullhead-chinos">Bullhead Chinos</h2>
<p>In an effort to expand my wardrobe, I gave chinos a try. These fit great, so comfy. Just skinny enough: they come in 28×30 and look damn sexy every day. My wife says she loves them ((I think she likes to stare)).</p>
<h2 id="cole-haan-franklin-saddle-shoes">Cole Haan Franklin Saddle Shoes</h2>
<p>Alyssa bought these for me as a “congratulations on the new job” present. They look sharp with jeans or dress pants (and chinos!). I wear them every day.</p>



<h1>Listening to Malcolm Gladwell on American Religious Tolerance</h1>
<iframe width="100%" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/141226393&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;visual=true"></iframe>

<p>Malcolm Gladwell makes an interesting observation here on the limits of general American tolerance: we’ll tolerate just about any difference right up to the point that you stop trying to become more like “us.” This strikes me as not just true about religious tolerance as is the context of this interview, but also in a much more general sense.</p>
<p>Overall, it&#39;s a great little discussion of how we view others who hold different beliefs, the inconsistancies we have in those views, and what that means for our society. Very balanced, very thoughtful &emdash; definitely worth a listen.</p>
